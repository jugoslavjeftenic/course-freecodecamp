                    CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change
                    the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages,
                    but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block,
                    but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).
                    Flexbox helped out, but it’s intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones
                    (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well together). Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout
                    problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.

                <header>Basics and browser support</header>
                <p>
                    As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS Grid: Chrome (including on Android),
                    Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera. Internet Explorer 10 and 11 on the other hand support it,
                    but it’s an old implementation with an outdated syntax. The time to build with grid is now!
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with <code>display: grid</code>,
                    set the column and row sizes with <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code>,
                    and then place its child elements into the grid with <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code>.
                    Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn’t matter. Your CSS can place them in any order,
                    which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page,
                    and then completely rearranging it to accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple lines of CSS.
                    Grid is one of the most powerful CSS modules ever introduced.

                <p>
                    Before diving into the concepts of Grid it’s important to understand the terminology.
                    Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it’s easy to confuse them with one another
                    if you don’t first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don’t worry, there aren’t many of them.

                        <p>The element on which <code>display: grid</code> is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items.</p>

                            Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values.
                            The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.

                            Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the
                            <code>grid-area</code> property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells.
                            A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.

                            Sometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container.
                            This could happen if all of your grid items are sized with non-flexible units like px.
                            In this case you can set the alignment of the grid within the grid container.
                            This property aligns the grid along the inline (row) axis
                            (as opposed to <code>align-content</code> which aligns the grid along the block (column) axis).

                        <p>
                            Specifies the size of any auto-generated grid tracks (aka implicit grid tracks).
                            Implicit tracks get created when there are more grid items than cells in the grid or
                            when a grid item is placed outside of the explicit grid.

                            If you have grid items that you don’t explicitly place on the grid, the <em>auto-placement algorithm</em> kicks in to
                            automatically place the items. This property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works.

                            (Note: You can only specify the explicit or the implicit grid properties in a single grid declaration).

                        <p>grid-row-end</p>
                        <p>
                            Determines a grid item’s location within the grid by referring to specific grid lines.
                            <code>grid-column-start</code>/<code>grid-row-start</code> is the line where the item begins,
                            and <code>grid-column-end</code>/<code>grid-row-end</code> is the line where the item ends.

                            Gives an item a name so that it can be referenced by a template created with the <code>grid-template-areas</code> property.
                            Alternatively, this property can be used as an even shorter shorthand for
                            <code>grid-row-start</code> + <code>grid-column-start</code> + <code>grid-row-end</code> + <code>grid-column-end</code>.

                            along the block (column) axis). This value applies to a grid item inside a single cell.
