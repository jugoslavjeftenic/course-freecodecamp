                <h1>Dune</h1>
                <p>
                    Arguably a masterpiece of the Science Fiction genre, Dune laid the foundation for many of the epics that followed its publication.
                    Herbert addresses overarching themes of family politics, religion, environment, and the all-encompassing temptation of power,
                    all set against the backdrop of a futuristic civilization that, at times, can be unflinchingly prophetic.
                    You will taste the sand in your mouth and soon be hungry for the next installment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides,
                    heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange,
                    a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness.
                    Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for...
                </p>
                <p>
                    When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he
                    could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most
                    ancient and unattainable dream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award,
                    shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.
